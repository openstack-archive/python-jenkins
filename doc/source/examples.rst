Using Python-Jenkins
====================

The python-jenkins library allows management of a Jenkins server through
the Jenkins REST endpoints. Below are examples to get you started using
the library.  If you need further help take a look at the :doc:`api`
docs for more details.


Example 1: Get version of Jenkins
---------------------------------

This is an example showing how to connect to a Jenkins instance and
retrieve the Jenkins server version.

::

    import jenkins

    server = jenkins.Jenkins('http://localhost:8080', username='myuser', password='mypassword')
    user = server.get_whoami()
    version = server.get_version()
    print('Hello %s from Jenkins %s' % (user['fullName'], version))

The above code prints the fullName attribute of the user and the version of
the Jenkins master running on 'localhost:8080'. For example, it may print
"Hello John from Jenkins 2.0".

From Jenkins vesion 1.426 onward you can specify an API token instead of your
real password while authenticating the user against the Jenkins instance.
Refer to the `Jenkins Authentication`_ wiki for details about how you
can generate an API token. Once you have an API token you can pass the API token
instead of a real password while creating a Jenkins instance.

Example 2: Logging into Jenkins using kerberos
----------------------------------------------

Kerberos support is only enabled if you have "kerberos" python package installed.
You can install the "kerberos" package from PyPI using the obvious pip command.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install kerberos

.. note:: This might require python header files as well
    as kerberos header files.

If you have "kerberos" python package installed, python-jenkins tries to authenticate
using kerberos automatically when the Jenkins server replies "401 Unauthorized"
and indicates it supports kerberos.  That is, kerberos authentication should
work automagically. For a quick test, just try the following.

::

    import jenkins

    server = jenkins.Jenkins('http://localhost:8080')
    print server.jobs_count()

.. note:: Jenkins as such does not support kerberos, it needs to be supported by
    the Servlet container or a reverse proxy sitting in front of Jenkins.


Example 3: Working with Jenkins Jobs
------------------------------------

This is an example showing how to create, configure and delete Jenkins jobs.

::

    server.create_job('empty', jenkins.EMPTY_CONFIG_XML)
    jobs = server.get_jobs()
    print jobs
    my_job = server.get_job_config('cool-job')
    print(my_job) # prints XML configuration
    server.build_job('empty')
    server.disable_job('empty')
    server.copy_job('empty', 'empty_copy')
    server.enable_job('empty_copy')
    server.reconfig_job('empty_copy', jenkins.RECONFIG_XML)

    server.delete_job('empty')
    server.delete_job('empty_copy')

    # build a parameterized job
    # requires creating and configuring the api-test job to accept 'param1' & 'param2'
    server.build_job('api-test', {'param1': 'test value 1', 'param2': 'test value 2'})
    last_build_number = server.get_job_info('api-test')['lastCompletedBuild']['number']
    build_info = server.get_build_info('api-test', last_build_number)
    print build_info

    # get all jobs from the specific view
    jobs = server.get_jobs(view_name='View Name')
    print jobs


Example 4: Working with Jenkins Views
-------------------------------------

This is an example showing how to create, configure and delete Jenkins views.

::

    server.create_view('EMPTY', jenkins.EMPTY_VIEW_CONFIG_XML)
    view_config = server.get_view_config('EMPTY')
    views = server.get_views()
    server.delete_view('EMPTY')
    print views


Example 5: Working with Jenkins Plugins
---------------------------------------

This is an example showing how to retrieve Jenkins plugins information.

::

    plugins = server.get_plugins_info()
    print plugins

The above example will print a dictionary containing all the plugins that
are installed on the Jenkins server.  An example of what you can expect
from the :func:`get_plugins_info` method is documented in the :doc:`api`
doc.


Example 6: Working with Jenkins Nodes
-------------------------------------

This is an example showing how to add, configure, enable and delete Jenkins nodes.

::

    server.create_node('slave1')
    nodes = get_nodes()
    print nodes
    node_config = server.get_node_info('slave1')
    print node_config
    server.disable_node('slave1')
    server.enable_node('slave1')

    # create node with parameters
    params = {
        'port': '22',
        'username': 'juser',
        'credentialsId': '10f3a3c8-be35-327e-b60b-a3e5edb0e45f',
        'host': 'my.jenkins.slave1'
    }
    server.create_node(
        'slave1',
        nodeDescription='my test slave',
        remoteFS='/home/juser',
        labels='precise',
        exclusive=True,
        launcher=jenkins.LAUNCHER_SSH,
        launcher_params=params)

Example 7: Working with Jenkins Build Queue
-------------------------------------------

This is an example showing how to retrieve information on the Jenkins queue.

::

    server.build_job('foo')
    queue_info = server.get_queue_info()
    id = queue_info[0].get('id')
    server.cancel_queue(id)


Example 8: Working with Jenkins Cloudbees Folders
-------------------------------------------------

Requires the `Cloudbees Folders Plugin
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin>`_ for
Jenkins.

This is an example showing how to create, configure and delete Jenkins folders.

::

    server.create_job('folder', jenkins.EMPTY_FOLDER_XML)
    server.create_job('folder/empty', jenkins.EMPTY_FOLDER_XML)
    server.copy_job('folder/empty', 'folder/empty_copy')
    server.delete_job('folder/empty_copy')
    server.delete_job('folder')


Example 9: Updating Next Build Number
-------------------------------------

Requires the `Next Build Number Plugin
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Next+Build+Number+Plugin>`_
for Jenkins.

This is an example showing how to update the next build number for a
Jenkins job.

::

    next_bn = server.get_job_info('job_name')['nextBuildNumber']
    server.set_next_build_number('job_name', next_bn + 50)


Example 9: Working with Build Promotions
----------------------------------------

Requires the `Promoted Builds Plugin
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Promoted+Builds+Plugin>`_
for Jenkins.

This is an example showing how to create, configure and delete a
promotion process for an existing job.

The job in this example is named *prom_job* and it needs to have this
config xml snippet before creating the promotion:

::

    <properties>
       <hudson.plugins.promoted__builds.JobPropertyImpl>
       <activeProcessNames>
          <string>prom_name</string>
        </activeProcessNames>
      </hudson.plugins.promoted__builds.JobPropertyImpl>
    </properties>

where *prom_name* is the name of the promotion that will get added to the job.

::

    server.create_promotion('prom_name', 'prom_job', jenkins.EMPTY_PROMO_CONFIG_XML)
    server.promotion_exists('prom_name', 'prom_job')
    print server.get_promotions('prom_job')

    server.reconfig_promotion('prom_name', 'prom_job', jenkins.PROMO_RECONFIG_XML)
    print server.get_promotion_config('prom_name', 'prom_job')

    server.delete_promotion('prom_name', 'prom_job')


Example 10: Waiting for Jenkins to be ready
-------------------------------------------

It is possible to ask the API to wait for Jenkins to be ready with a given
timeout. This can be used to aid launching of Jenkins and then waiting for the
REST API to be responsive before continuing with subsequent configuration.

::

    # timeout here is the socket connection timeout, for each connection
    # attempt it will wait at most 5 seconds before assuming there is
    # nothing listening. Useful where firewalls may black hole connections.
    server = jenkins.Jenkins('http://localhost:8080', timeout=5)

    # wait for at least 30 seconds for Jenkins to be ready
    if server.wait_for_normal_op(30):
        # actions once running
        ...
    else:
        print("Jenkins failed to be ready in sufficient time")
        exit 2

Note that the timeout arg to `jenkins.Jenkins()` is the socket connection
timeout. If you set this to be more than the timeout value passed to
`wait_for_normal_op()`, then in cases where the underlying connection is not
rejected (firewall black-hole, or slow connection) then `wait_for_normal_op()`
may wait at least the connection timeout, or a multiple of it where multiple
connection attempts are made. A connection timeout of 5 seconds and a wait
timeout of 8 will result in potentially waiting 10 seconds if both connections
attempts do not get responses.
